## Reasons

- [Printer Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code) - Laser printers hide tracking dots in every page which helps trace documents back to you.
- [Screen Scraping](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/your-tv-is-probably-tracking-you-heres-how-to-stop-it/) - Nearly every TV manufacturer scrapes your screen, figures out what you're watching, and sells your viewing history.
- [Crowdsourced WiFi Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system) - Most popular electronics monitor WiFi access points in the background and build detailed maps, which can later be used to locate devices without using GPS.
- [Phone Location](https://www.vice.com/en/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile) - Telephone providers can easily track your phone using cell towers, but typically it's reserved for emergency services. AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint were caught selling to private buyers.
- [Government Surveillance](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/how-it-works) - The NSA collected, mined, and archived all domestic phone and email traffic.
